### Hey!

I'm Pablo, someone who is passionate about writing code. I work for [AYESA](https://www.ayesa.com/) as a Backend Developer.

I mostly use Java with Spring Boot. I am currently learning about Reactive Programming, Go, Docker, and Kubernetes.

Other than that, I also use GNU/Linux.

You can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pa-perz/) or email (pa_perz [at] outlook [dot] es).
